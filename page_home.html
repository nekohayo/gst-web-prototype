<h1>GStreamer is a Free &amp; Open Source cross-platform multimedia framework.</h1>
<p>It allows you to quickly develop powerful media-centric applications and to take advantage of the latest advances in codec &amp; filter technology. If something is missing, you can add new codecs and filters by writing simple plugins with a clean, standardized interface.</p>
<p>GStreamer's highly extensible, pipeline-based, modular architecture makes it the #1 choice for media and processing-intensive applications. <a href="/tour">Learn moreâ€¦</a></p>

<!--<p>GStreamer is a library for constructing graphs of
media-handling components. The applications it supports range from simple
Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio (mixing) and video
(non-linear editing) processing.
</p>
<p>Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter technology 
transparently.  Developers can add new codecs and filters by writing a
simple plugin with a clean, generic interface.

<p>GStreamer is released under the LGPL. The 1.x series is API and ABI stable
and supersedes the previous stable 0.10 series. Both can be installed in
parallel.</p>
